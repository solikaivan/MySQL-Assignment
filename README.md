# Netflix Shows Dataset

## Description
This project involves working with a dataset of Netflix shows. The dataset includes information about various shows available on Netflix, including show ID, title, director, release year, and more.

## Importing the Dataset into MySQL Workbench

### Steps:
1. **Download the Dataset**:
   - Download the "Netflix Shows" dataset from the provided link.

2. **Create Database and Table**:
   - Create a new database named `netflix` in MySQL Workbench.
   - Create a table named `netflix_shows` with columns that match the dataset structure.

3. **Import the CSV File**:
   - Use the `Data Import` feature in MySQL Workbench to import the CSV file into the `netflix_shows` table.

### Possible Difficulties:
- **File Encoding Issues**: Ensure that the CSV file encoding matches the database encoding to avoid any character encoding problems.
- **Data Type Mismatch**: Verify that the data types in the MySQL table match the corresponding data in the CSV file to prevent import errors.
